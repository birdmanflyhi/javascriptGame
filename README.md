2d javascript canvas game tutorial follow
I followed the tutorial from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript
I made a few changes like the number of blocks in the game to destroy. Also,
I didn't follow every recommendation like relying on the browser to determine frame rate speed because while the tutorial says it makes 
for a smoother game experience it actually slowed down the gameplay ALOT to the point where it wasn't even hard to beat the game. So I
liked the 'older' method of 'var interval = setInterval(draw, 10);'
I also changed the game to my own colors because I love blue and thought it was fitting. Enjoy!
